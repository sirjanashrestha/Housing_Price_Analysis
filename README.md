In this project, we will
- Analyse the relation of house prices with various factors such as  year, region, immigration and lending rate
- Predict house prices for next 5 years

## Methodology 
- Collect data from different sources
- Perform Exploratory Data analysis on the datasets
- Create a machine learning model and estimate accuracy
- Create a visualization of the results

## Tools and Technologies used
- Git Bash
- Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook
- PostgreSQL
- Python Packages
    - NumPy
    - SciPy
    - Scikit Learn
- Machine learning algorithm: Linear regression

## Datasets
- Features of model: Lending Rate, Immigration, Region, Year
- Target variable: Price
- Timeframe of analysis: January 2005-September 2022

## Assumptions
- Prime lending rate is used for all region
-
