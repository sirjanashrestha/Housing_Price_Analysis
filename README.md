Canada is one of the top real estate market in world. The aftermath of covid pandemic and economic downturn has slowed down real estate market of Canada with declining sales in 2022. However, real estate market in Canada is very competitive and is often considered by majority of people as best long term investment.

## Problem Statement
In this project, we will
- Analyse the relation of house prices with various factors such as  year, region, immigration and lending rate
- Predict house prices for next 5 years

## Methodology 
- Collect data from different sources
- Perform Exploratory Data analysis on the datasets
- Create a machine learning model and estimate accuracy
- Create a visualization of the results
- Create [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17urz7OMdW8Qi5NzWePaZ6ScvPWxBlKx10AwSCiOk1jo/edit#slide=id.g17505948ed0_0_140)
